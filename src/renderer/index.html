  PURPOSE: This is the HTML entry point for the RENDERER process (the React UI).
           When Electron loads the renderer, it loads THIS HTML file, which in turn
           loads the React application via the <script> tag at the bottom.

  HOW THIS FITS IN THE APP (for beginners):
    Electron's main window loads this HTML file. The HTML provides:
    1. A <div id="root"> — the empty container where React will render the entire UI
    2. A <script> tag — tells the browser to load and execute the React app code (main.tsx)

  The resulting UI appears as the LEFT SIDEBAR (450px wide) in the application window.
  The RIGHT side of the window is the BrowserView showing the WorkAtAStartup website.

<!-- DOCTYPE declaration — tells the browser this is an HTML5 document -->
<!doctype html>

<!-- The root <html> element — contains the entire page -->
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Set the character encoding to UTF-8 (supports international characters, emojis, etc.) -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <!-- The page title — appears in the window title bar -->
    <title>mini-tsenta</title>

    <!-- Content Security Policy (CSP) — a security measure that restricts what resources
         the page is allowed to load. This protects against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

    <!-- CSP Rules explained:
         - default-src 'self': by default, only allow loading resources from the same origin (our app)
         - script-src 'self': only allow JavaScript from our own app (blocks injected scripts)
         - style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline': allow CSS from our app AND inline styles
           ('unsafe-inline' is needed because many CSS-in-JS solutions use inline styles)
         - img-src 'self' data:: allow images from our app AND data: URIs (base64-encoded images) -->

  <body>
    <!-- This empty <div> is where the entire React application will be rendered.
         React's createRoot() function (in main.tsx) targets this element by its "root" ID
         and replaces its contents with the React component tree. -->
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!-- Load the React application entry point (main.tsx).
         type="module" tells the browser to treat this as an ES Module (supports import/export syntax).
         During development, Vite serves this file from its dev server with hot module replacement.
         In production, this is bundled into optimized JavaScript files. -->
